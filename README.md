# DS3002-Project2
You're trying to decide if you want to spend the money to fly to La Jolla for summer vacation or to safe money and drive to Virginia Beach. 

By mentioning either "La Jolla" or "Virginia Beach" to @DS3002-Bot on Twitter, you can see the current temperature in those locations in order to decide whether or not it would be worth it to fly out to California. If the weather is equally as nice at Virginia Beach, it would make more sense just to drive there instead, so you can save money. 

By mentioning "help", the @DS3002-Bot will prompt you to specify either Virginia Beach or La Jolla so it can provide you with the current temperature.
